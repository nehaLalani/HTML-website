    <p id="info"> As a person who has Asthma, I wanted to insert an infographic about the disease. In this "About Me" page, I thought I would include everything about me. I have suffered with Asthma since I was a kid and it is not something that I always like to talk about. Because this is a webpage about my life, I thought it would be a good idea to put it in.
